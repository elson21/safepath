# Stalker Tracker - WiFi Stalking Detection Device

A wearable device that detects potential stalking by monitoring persistent Wi-Fi MAC addresses in your vicinity.

## üéØ Concept

Instead of tracking a victim after an incident, this device **prevents incidents** by warning the wearer when someone is persistently following them based on WiFi signature patterns.

## üéØ End Goal: Hybrid System

**Device (Wearable):**
- Does the grunt work: WiFi scanning, MAC tracking, local alerts
- Always-on, low power, discreet
- Works standalone OR paired with phone

**Mobile App (Companion):**
- Configuration: sensitivity, ignore lists, alert preferences
- Alert history and pattern logging
- **Parental controls**: Monitor child's alerts remotely
- GPS tracking when alert triggered
- Export data for analysis
- Cloud sync for multiple devices

**Use Cases:**
- Kids wear device, parents monitor via app
- Adults use device standalone with optional app features
- Family members can share ignore lists across devices

- [ ] Cross-platform app (Flutter/React Native)

### Phase 8: üîê Security & Privacy
**Status:** ‚¨ú Not Started  
**Goal:** Ensure data privacy and secure communication

- [ ] End-to-end encryption for device ‚Üî app communication
- [ ] Secure cloud storage (encrypted at rest)
- [ ] User data privacy compliance (GDPR, COPPA for children)
- [ ] Parental consent mechanisms
- [ ] Local-only mode (no cloud sync option)
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Security audit and documentation

## üîß Current Hardware Setup

**Prototype Phase 1:**
- ESP32-C3 DevKit board
- Built-in LED for alerts
- USB cable for power and programming
- Breadboard development environment

**Future Hardware (Phase 2+):**
- Small 3D printed enclosure
- LiPo battery for portability
- Vibration motor
- Eventually: Custom PCB in pendant form factor

## üßÆ Detection Logic

1. Scan WiFi probe requests every few seconds
2. Store MAC addresses with timestamps
3. Count occurrences within 15-minute sliding window
4. Alert if same MAC appears 5+ times (threshold)
5. Clean up old entries to manage memory

## üéÅ Planned Features (Post-MVP)

**Device Features:**
- Vibration motor for discreet alerts
- Multiple alert patterns (different threat levels)
- Standalone operation without phone
- Water resistance for daily wear

**App Features:**
- Parental monitoring dashboard
- Real-time alert push notifications
- GPS location when alert triggered
- Alert history with map visualization
- Custom threshold configurations per environment
- Shared family ignore lists
- Multi-device management (track multiple kids)
- Emergency contact integration
- Cloud sync and backup

## üìê Target Final Form Factor

- Wearable pendant (30mm √ó 40mm √ó 8mm)
- 450mAh LiPo battery
- USB-C charging
- 4-6 hours continuous operation

## üîç Background

Inspired by the [Chasing Your Tail](https://github.com/ArgeliusLabs/Chasing-Your-Tail-NG) project but miniaturized for personal wearable use, particularly for vulnerable individuals like children.

**Key Differences from Chasing Your Tail:**
- Ultra-portable vs. Raspberry Pi setup
- Real-time alerts vs. post-analysis reports
- Simple threshold detection vs. complex GPS/WiGLE integration
- Prevention focus vs. evidence gathering
